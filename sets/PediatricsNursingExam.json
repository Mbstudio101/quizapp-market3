Solution
Step 1 is to convert the patient's weight from pounds to kilograms. 59 pounds ÷ 2.2 kg/pound = 26.8181. kg. We will use the unrounded number for the next step.
Step 2 is to calculate the daily fluid requirement based on the Holliday-Segar method. The patient weighs 26.8181. kg, which is more than 20 kg. Fluid for the first 10 kg: 10 kg × 100 mL/kg = 1000 mL. Fluid for the second 10 kg: 10 kg × 50 mL/kg = 500 mL. Remaining weight: 26.8181. kg - 20 kg = 6.8181. kg. Fluid for the remaining weight: 6.8181. kg × 20 mL/kg = 136.3636. mL.
Step 3 is to calculate the total daily fluid requirement. 1000 mL + 500 mL + 136.3636. mL = 1636.3636. mL.
Step 4 is to round the final answer to the nearest whole number. 1636.3636. mL rounded to the nearest whole number is 1636. The daily fluid requirement is 1636 mL.
