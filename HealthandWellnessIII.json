        "explanation" : "Early decelerations are not indicative of increased fetal intracranial pressure. They are characterized by a gradual decrease in fetal heart rate (FHR) that mirrors the contraction, with the nadir of the deceleration occurring at the peak of the contraction. This pattern is considered benign and is caused by fetal head compression during a uterine contraction, which stimulates the vagus nerve and results in a transient, brief decrease in FHR.\n\nThe term \"present decelerations\" is not a recognized classification for fetal heart rate patterns. Fetal heart rate (FHR) decelerations are categorized as early, late, or variable, each corresponding to a different underlying physiological cause. Passage through the cervix is a mechanical process; while it causes head compression, the resulting FHR change is the early deceleration pattern.\n\nThe term \"absent deceleration\" is not a specific fetal heart rate pattern. A baseline fetal heart rate that remains within the normal range of 110 to 160 beats per minute (bpm) with no periodic changes (decelerations or accelerations) is a normal finding. Fetal movement is primarily assessed by accelerations in the FHR, which are increases of at least 15 bpm lasting 15 seconds or more.\n\nVariable decelerations are characterized by an abrupt decrease in FHR, often V or W-shaped, varying in duration and depth, and not consistently related to uterine contractions. They are the most common pattern in the second stage and indicate a transient occlusion of the umbilical cord, leading to a temporary decrease in umbilical blood flow and thus fetal oxygenation.",

        "explanation" : "Oxytocin is an uterotonic agent used to induce or augment labor or to prevent\/control postpartum hemorrhage; it has no role in correcting hypotension caused by a neuraxial block, such as an epidural. The hypotension is due to sympathetic blockade causing peripheral vasodilation and subsequent venous pooling, decreasing venous return and cardiac output.\n\nWhile oxygen administration may be part of the treatment for fetal distress secondary to maternal hypotension, administering it at 6 liters via face mask is not the priority action. The immediate priority is to restore maternal blood pressure to ensure adequate placental perfusion and oxygen delivery to the fetus by increasing preload.\n\nTurning the client to the lateral position (left side preferred) displaces the uterus off the vena cava, alleviating aortocaval compression and improving venous return to the heart. Increasing intravenous fluids (a rapid bolus) expands the intravascular volume, which increases preload and helps counteract the vasodilation, thereby restoring blood pressure to the normal range of 90\/60 to 140\/90 mmHg.\n\nRaising the head of the bed would worsen the hypotension because it promotes gravitational pooling of blood in the lower extremities, further decreasing venous return to the heart and exacerbating the drop in cardiac output. The preferred position is lateral (side-lying) or a slight Trendelenburg (feet higher than head) to promote blood return",

It is the softening of the lower uterine segment or isthmus, typically occurring about 6-12 weeks gestation due to increased vascularity and fluid accumulation. Probable signs are objective, detectable by a provider, but can be caused by conditions other than pregnancy, making them less definitive than positive signs.\n\nQuickening is the mother's first perception of fetal movement, usually felt between 16-20 weeks gestation. This is considered a presumptive sign of pregnancy. Presumptive signs are the subjective changes experienced and reported by the woman, suggesting pregnancy, but they can be attributed to many other conditions (e.g., gas, peristalsis), hence they are the least reliable indicators.\n\nChadwick sign is a probable sign of pregnancy. It is the deep, dusky-blue coloration of the vaginal and cervical mucosa due to increased blood flow (hyperemia) and vascularity, often observable from 6-8 weeks gestation. Probable signs are objective changes noted by a provider but are not absolutely specific to pregnancy, as other conditions could cause pelvic vascular congestion.\n\nA Positive pregnancy test (urine or serum) is considered a probable sign of pregnancy. These tests detect the presence of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG). While highly reliable, conditions like hydatidiform mole or certain medications can cause a false positive result, preventing it from being a definitive positive sign, which only includes visualization of the fetus, fetal heart tones, or palpation of fetal movement by an examiner.",

        "explanation" : "Epidural anesthesia is a highly effective pharmacologic pain management option for labor, but it is typically offered later in the active phase of labor or upon request. At 3 cm dilation, the client is in the early (latent) phase of the first stage of labor. While the client can receive it, the initial nursing priority is often to promote comfort and coping with non-pharmacologic measures before resorting to invasive procedures.\n\nThe client is in the early (latent) phase of the first stage of labor, defined as 0-5 cm cervical dilation and 0-40% effacement. This phase is characterized by milder, less frequent contractions, and the client is typically alert and excited. The nursing priority is to encourage non-pharmacologic coping strategies like ambulation, hydrotherapy, breathing techniques, and position changes, which promote comfort, manage pain, and encourage labor progression before the active phase.\n\nNarcotic analgesia (opioids) can be used for pain relief in early labor, but they can cause fetal\/neonatal respiratory depression, maternal drowsiness, and potential nausea. Given the client is at 3 cm, this is the latent phase, and non-pharmacologic methods are typically encouraged first. Pharmacologic agents are often reserved for when non-pharmacologic methods are insufficient or the client enters the active phase (6 cm or more).\n\nA client in active labor, particularly one receiving analgesia, is at risk of aspiration should an emergency Cesarean section be required under general anesthesia.

Strict aseptic technique is mandatory to minimize this transient risk, which stems from the passage of the device through the cervix.\n\nUterine perforation is a rare but serious complication, occurring most often at the time of insertion when the sound or the IUD itself punctures the uterine wall, which can lead to intra-abdominal placement or damage to adjacent organs. Risk factors include a recently postpartum or lactating uterus, which is softer and more pliable.\n\n\nAn intrauterine device prevents uterine implantation, but it does not prevent fertilization. If pregnancy occurs with an IUD in place, there is a significantly increased risk that the fertilized ovum will implant outside the uterus, most commonly in the fallopian tube, resulting in a potentially life-threatening ectopic pregnancy for the woman.",
